## Gadgets.  I like gadgets.  I found lots of them when I went looking.  I probably could've found more but I was afraid to go into the attic! Here's a selection.

There's **Alexa** (of course) - more formally the **Amazon Echo**.  Still haven't managed to convince her she's not in Seattle (or in the USA for that matter), but she does get the time right - yay! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/45c5280f-f9bb-41e0-b145-c138cdc2fc6b.png)

She's still a work in progress but I'm looking forward to playing with her and IFTTT.  She's been joined by the **Dot** and **Tap** in the last couple of days - I'm gonna have some fun :-)

Everybody needs at least 3 game controllers, right? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4d2f936b-1568-4978-8711-30acecc912dc.png)

OK, I know that you gamers out there have dozens of the things, but it's not like I even game that much.  No doubt you will have spotted the **Ouya** one.  Of course there's the associated box (under the stairs somewhere).  I mainly use it for streaming using XBMC - haven't updated to Kodi yet.  Never did manage to get the hang of that darned Amazing Frog though.  (Note: found 3 more controllers overnight!)

I did have 2 **Apple TV**s (1st and 2nd Gen) but they're really not necessary anymore with all the streaming available on all the other platforms now.  I have a chromecast for the bedroom, but that's just to use an idle 24" monitor.  Sometimes there are football matches on at 3-4am - with the chromecast I can watch them in bed.

And who doesn't need at least 5 mice.  I know there are more lurking in the darker recesses of the house, but these were to hand. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8f99c1cf-d73d-49e6-bed4-c798086831d2.png)

I have a magic mouse too (which I hate - nothing magic about it.  But wait...hmm...it did change my folding into a lump of useless plastic).  I do like the little **Swiftpoint** though.  It's really neat, and originally from New Zealand, although it's since been bought by Belkin.  It works with my **Surface Pro 4** and **macmini**.  I got the 2 trackballs to try out with some seniors in a local retirement village.  I left another one with them.  Due to mobility issues it's often easier for seniors to move a trackball than a mouse.

Found 4 more mice overnight when looking for something else.  Another **MS**, an old **Wacom**, a **Razer** and this wireless pen one: ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e03ffc08-2964-40b0-833f-174bd77983e8.png)

Then there are the keyboards.....wired, wireless, bluetooth, portable, convertible...I've got them all.  My favourite (and the one I'm using to type this) is my most recent purchase - a **Filco Majestouch Convertible**.  It's great having something so tactile (and, dare I say, so old fashioned).  Travelling light to the US and UK in 2014 I took this **Verbatim**. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/04eb77ce-045d-4c1e-b6ff-e3b5213882fe.png)

Although made for the Apple stable, it worked really well with my **Samsung Galaxy Note 3** and the **AnySoftKeyboard** app.

Here's one of my (award winning) **Blue Room HousePods**.  OK, they're not gadgets as such, but you have to admit that they look cool.  They've a pretty decent sound too.  I'm not sure how many were originally produced, but mine are numbered 001331 and 001332\.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/90d70df4-7b32-4a8b-8a7a-836a782fa92b.png)

There's a really interesting site detailing their history and inextricable links to **B&W **[here][0].   I use them in combination with my **B&W** 802s.  You should check out the Dadara Baby versions - they're collector's items now.

A bit of trivia (considering The Grid beta) is that there were some white HousePods used in a video for UK band "The Grid".

How about **Google Cardboard** - is that technically a gadget?  It's used with gadgets; maybe that qualifies.  Thought it rated a mention anyway, considering all the hype about VR at the moment.  I use it, awkwardly, with my **Galaxy Note 4**.

Now for a couple of other historical items.  Who can forget the **Sony Discman**!
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/72ae2ff4-4c18-427c-99e2-bdda386a460c.png)

Yes, I still use it from time to time hooked up to a **Tivoli** radio in the kitchen.  In the days when I was fitter I used it when I exercised.

Here's a really old **Kenwood Sodastream**.  Notice how much skinnier they were back then.  The old glass bottles I use with it take 200ml (up to the line), a far cry from the newer "oversize me" ones.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/da2a8f89-716b-4174-af16-0b6c34291b3e.png)

Another kitchen gadget (which I should really part with as it's been gathering dust) is **Oscar**.  Made by **Nuova Simonelli** and quite a cut above the old Saeco I had years ago.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6070a8da-cdee-49f4-87cf-e973c040a3ee.png)

One that's definitely not a dust gatherer and I don't think I could survive without is my **Kindle**.  It might be one of the older ones, but as they say, if it ain't broke..... (although it didn't stop me having a play with the screen saver :-)). ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2b83fb13-07c0-4902-b9dd-68e3d5cd6446.png)

Pictured here with a set of **Kinivo bluetooth headphones** (needless to say I have about 4 sets of headphones, from **Grado** and **BlackBox** to **XBox** headsets and **Bose QuietComfort 20**s).  In-ear iPod and Galaxy ones don't count.  

I didn't mention the 3 **iPod**s, **iPad 2**, **Asus Eee Pad** and **Colorfly C4 Pro**, did I?  I couldn't find the Colorfly due to the clutter (eyes roll), but here's a pic.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3e5ae090-75de-4068-a660-cd01c6ebe29c.png)

Let's not forget this blast from the past;  one of Sir Clive Sinclair's earlier projects - the **Sinclair Cambridge Programmable**!  So old that the plastic cover was sticking to the case when I tried to extricate it.  Sir Clive was responsible for a lot of (then) cool stuff, except the **C5** scooter - still uncool.  I did have a **Sinclair Spectrum** at one stage but it's long gone.

Unfortunately it's dead to the world now - a leaked battery did the damage.

I used to play chess some years ago.  I got this **Saitek** board before PCs took over.  It still works.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9267bda5-6f61-4630-9b3e-66659fe31765.png)

They used to have the games on TV back then - Kasparov, Karpov, Fisher, Short - exciting viewing!  It was usually more contentious off-screen than on though.  They could be quite the prima donnas at times.

Let's not forget **Kickstarter** and similar sites.  Yes, I'm all too easily led.  Quick selection - **Gekkopod** holding my Dad's **Carl Zeiss Nettar** camera (515/16?), **Solar Puff** and **MYO** Armband.

If you like gadgets, I think you have to like clocks too - at least the mechanical ones.  There used to be a flea market close to where I lived in Dublin.  One of the shops sold unusual clocks.  They had ones like Dali's "Persistence of Time", and this anti-clockwise one which I still use today.  You can get much fancier ones now.  \[I used to have one of those **Casio** calculator watches - lasted for 21 years!\]
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/01f8cec5-80a8-431c-a62f-c3019939f6c5.png)

I bought a Toast clock from the seller too - real toast.  It disappeared.  Really.  I went away for a few days once and when I returned there was the movement on the floor surrounded by crumbs - the mice had got it!

Don't have any pets - work interferes - so got an aquarium.  Good luck finding Nemo in this one!

# Smart Home

I could go off on a tangent here and start talking about the smart home.  Of course I have the rack under the stairs - a Control4 system, Ring doorbell, IP cameras, Wemo switches (for the Echo), a smart alarm system, electronic door lock, timed irrigation system etc.,etc., but that's a whole other can of worms.  Maybe some other day, eh.

With the IoT coming I may have to go back to the beginning and rethink everything.  It's going to be useful all right, but at what cost, and no, I don't mean financial.  There's privacy, idleness, job losses (OK, what's lost in one place will probably be gained elsewhere - doesn't make it easier to take though), lack of social contact and so on.

Anyway, enough pontificating.  I didn't mean to get philosophical when I started this and there's so much more that could be said and other viewpoints to take that it would be a pointless exercise.

Here's a selection.</h1><p>I did have 2 Apple TVs (1st and 2nd Gen) but they're really not necessary anymore with all the streaming available on all the other platforms now.  I have a chromecast for the bedroom, but that's just to use an idle 24" monitor.  Sometimes there are football matches on at 3-4am - with the chromecast I can watch them in bed.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/97c889f2a9a3b3d55a176f62f121f2f4feea2201.jpg"></article>]]></description>
